						<h5>What is Learnercentric ?</h5>
						<p>
							At Learnercentric, we see education through the eyes of the
							learner. We tutor, coach, mentor and guide students to
							successfully and joyfully navigate their learning journey. The all
							too common one-size-fits-all approach to education continues to
							under-serve a significant percentage of students, many of whom
							fall behind at various stages. Learnercentric seeks to change
							that. <br /><br />
							Working with students one-on-one and in small groups, we make
							education a very personalized, meaningful and rewarding
							exploration, enabling students to feel confident, capable and
							validated. With an iterative approach and an emphasis on gradual
							mastery of the topics, students master the core STEM subjects and
							connect the dots they weren’t able to before. Inspired with
							curiosity and confidence, the students find themselves
							increasingly in control of their learning.
